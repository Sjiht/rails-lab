== README

To run the app there are a few things that are required. 
The first thing is to change the hosts file. The line that needs to be added is:

0.0.0.0		tasks.teamtasks.ga

This makes sure to redirect the localhost path to a 'real' url to trick facebook in thinking it is a real website.
To access the app, run: rails server

Then the app can be viewed at:

http://tasks.teamtasks.ga:3000/

From there on the app works completely.
